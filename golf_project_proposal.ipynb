    "<p>Our topic focuses on finding the relationship between how crowded golf courses may be and weather as the weather may influence the amount of people going to the golf course. We do this by analyzing the dataset Golf Play Dataset Extended created by Samy Baladram. More specifically, we want to find out the relationship between crowdedness and weather in two seasons (temperature in winter and humidity in summer). </p>\n",

    "<p>This raises our predictive question we want to answer with regression: finding a specific value for crowdedness after predicting with temperature in winter and humidity in summer. The dataset we use provides extended golf-related information, including weather condition, humidity, temperature, seasons, time, and crowdedness. As assessed by Kaggle, the usability for this dataset is 10 out of 10, which suggests its great compatibility, reliability, and completeness. This dataset is also well-documented and clean so no much further cleaning and wrangling was needed. From the abundant data this dataset provides, we are able to analyze and predict the crowdedness based on the weather in two seasons. </p>"

    "<p>One important aspect we have identified is that the correlation we are interested in studying predominantly manifests during the winter and summer months. The crowdedness, a measure of how crowded the golf course was (ranging from 0 to 1), is affected by the low temperatures in winter and the humidity in the summer months. Therefore, our analysis will focus on these specific periods to draw meaningful insights. By limiting our analysis to these seasons, we will generate two distinct graphs, providing a clear and focused perspective on the relationship we aim to explore.</p>"
